	- git stash :::
		
		 - Used to maintain the uncommited changes to a temporary area.
		 
		 - Stash is List Data Structure 
		 
		 
		 
		 git stash list 
		 
		 git stash save "create from w1.txt"
		 
		 git stash apply 				# Apply the latest changes back to staging area 
		 
		 git stash apply stash@{3}		# Apply the specific change back to staging area 
		 
		 git stash drop 				# Delete the latest changes from the stash list
		 
		 git stash drop stash@{3}		# Delete the specific changes from the stash list
		 
		 git stash pop 					# Apply and delete the lastest changes
		 
		 git stash pop stash@{2}		# Apply and delete a specific change
		 
		 git stash clear 				# Clean-up the entire stash list
		 


	- github remote repos ::::
	
		- github :
		
		- gitlab/azRepos :
		
		
		Developers' Workload :
		
		- Enhancement/Bugfix Project
		- New Product development
		
		
		- git clone / git push / git fetch / pull
		
		
		
		- Pull Request :::
		
			- Created by the Developers 
			- It is used to merge the changes to main/master branch 
		
		
		- ML Project :
		
			- Tuning the Model 
		
		
		
		Git Cli Commands :::
			
			git clone 		-> To Copy/Clone the entire remote repository to Local Machine
			
			git add 		-> To Add the changes from working directory to staging area 
			
			git commit 		-> To Commit the changes from staging area to local repository
			
			git push		-> To Push the changes from local Repository to Remote Repository
		
			git fetch/pull :
			
				-> Both Git fetch and pull are used handle the incremental changes from remote repository.
				
				Git fetch :
				
					- It is used to just check for the incremental changes from remote repository, if any incremental changes exist, it will update the details of the changes only in local repository. Git fetch will never Update the Working Directory.
					
					- Do explicit merge to update the Working Directory					
					
			
				git Pull :
				
					- It is used to check for the incremental changes from remote repository, if any incremental changes exist, it will update the details of the changes in local repository as well as in the Working Directory.
					
					git pull => git fetch + git merge 
					
					To keep the local repo in sync with remote repo.

		- git clone <Repo_URL>
		
			- git clone https://github.com/Edu-MLOps-Feb26/TestRemoteRepo1.git		
		
		- git push 
		
			- git push -u origin localfeature1
			
			- Remote repo is needs token based authentication to push the changes 
			
			- Password based 
			
			- Token based : asdadasdao
			
	
		- git remote -v 			# To list the remote repos that are linked to local repo
			
		- git remote add origin https://github.com/Edu-MLOps-Feb26/TestRemoteRepo1.git		# To Add remote repo to local 
		
		- git remote remove origin 	# Remove remote repo link
		
		
	- VS Code :::
	
		-> Install VS Code 
		
		-> AWS Free Tier Account 
		
			- Login to AWS Account 
			
			- Create EC2 instance ==> Build Enviroment to Build the ML Project using git-actions CI

		- root user ID 
		
		- Password 
		
		- MFA 

			- Login to AWS Console as a root user 
			
			- Create IAM User user profile with Admin Access
			
		
			
		
		
			- AWS S3 Buckets -> To manage the ML Datasets 
		
	S3 Buckets :::
	
	
		--> Bucket = Directory
		
			--> Files -> Keys/ Objects
			
		--> Access to Create a S3 Bucket 	
		
		--> Create s3 Bucket 		--> loksai-edu-mlops-0208-bk

Set S3 Bucket Policy :

	  "Principal": "*",
	  "Action": [
		"s3:*"
	  ],
	  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::loksai-edu-mlops-0208-bkt/*"
	}
  ]
}		
	
		--> IAM Role to Access S3 Bucket using EC2 Instances (VM)	
		
		https://loksai-edu-mlops-0208-bkt.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/index.html
		
		
		
	Working with AWS Cli Commands to enable Process Automation :
	
	
	- Create IAM Role 		# It is used to give permission to EC2 Instance to access s3 Bucket 
							# loksai-edu-mlops-0208-role
							
	- Create EC2 Instance 	# loksai-edu-mlops-0208-Dev_Server
		-> Linux - ami: ubuntu 22.04v
		
		
		Authentication Methods/Types:
		
			- Password based Authentication
			- Token based Authentication		cli/api
			
			- Key Based Authentication
				- Public Key 
				- Private Key 
				
			- Passwordless Authentication
			
			
			Free-Tier Account --> 100$
			
			1 VM --> 750 Hrs/Month
