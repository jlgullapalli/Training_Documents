	MLOPs Essentials :::
	
	Lab Requirements :::
	
	Pre-requisites :::
	
	What is MLOps ???
	
	What is DevOps ???
	
	SDLC ? Software Development Life Cycle!
	
	Types of Software Applications?
	
		- Web Applications
		- Mobile Applications
		- Desktop Applications
		- Embedded Applications 
		- ML Applications
		
	Stages of SDLC :
	
		- Requirements Analysis 
		- Design/Documentation
		- Code/Development
		- Test
		- Implement to Prod 
		- Monitor/Maintain
	
	Waterfall Model :
	
		- It is based on Top-Approach
		- It used Linear path to engage all the stages of SDLC
		- Waterfall Model was meant for Monolith Application Architecture
			- Tightly Coupled
		
		
		
	
		- Requirements Analysis 
		- Design/Documentation
		- Code/Development
		- Test
		- Implement to Prod 
		- Monitor/Maintain	
	
	Eg.: Desktop Applications: SuperMarket Billing System 
	
		using Waterfall Model:
		
			SuperMarket Billing System :
				- Stock Maintain
				- Application User Interface Design 
				- Billing 
				- Payment 
					- CASH/CARD 
					- Online Payment/UPI		New Change

	Core Project:
	
		- Requirements Analysis 		--> 12 Months 
		- Design/Documentation
		- Code/Development							5th Month 
		- Test
		- Implement to Prod 
		- Monitor/Maintain		
	
	
	Enhancement Project:
	
		- Requirements Analysis 		--> 12 Months 
		- Design/Documentation
		- Code/Development							5th Month 
		- Test
		- Implement to Prod 
		- Monitor/Maintain	
	
	
	AGILE Methodologies :
	
		--> Here the functions/Modules are defined as Iterations.
		--> Each Iteration will be independently analysed and implemented.
		--> Supports Monolith & Micro-Service based Application Architecture
		--> It based on Task based approach.

		
	Stages of SDLC :

	Eg.: Desktop Applications: SuperMarket Billing System 
	
		using AGILE Methodologies:
		
			SuperMarket Billing System :
				- Stock Maintain
				- Application User Interface Design 
				- Billing 
				- Payment 
					- CASH/CARD 
					
					- Online Payment/UPI		New Change

	Iteration 1 : Stock Maintain
	
		- Requirements Analysis 
		- Design/Documentation
		- Code/Development
		- Test
		- Implement to Prod with proper approvals
	
	
	Iteration 2 : Application User Interface Design 
	
		- Requirements Analysis 
		- Design/Documentation
		- Code/Development
		- Test
		- Implement to Prod with proper approvals	
	
	
	Iteration 3 : Payment 
	
		- Requirements Analysis 
		- Design/Documentation
		- Code/Development
		- Test  100% 
		- Implement to Prod with proper approvals	
	
	
	Iteration nth : Online Payment/UPI
	
		- Requirements Analysis 
		- Design/Documentation
		- Code/Development
		- Test
		- Implement to Prod with proper approvals	
		
		
		
		- using AGILE Methodologies, we can able achieve :
		
			- Continuous Development
			- Continuous Integration 
			- Continuous Testing 
			- Continuous Delivery 
				- It is a process to release to changes to Prod Enviroment, This process expects Manual approvals for Prod release.
				
			
		- But, using AGILE Methodologies, we cannot achieve :
		
			- Continuous Deployment 
				- It is a process to release to changes to Prod Enviroment, This process Never expects any Manual intervension/approvals for Prod release.
				
				
	- Devops :::::
	
	- What is DevOps ???	

		--> DevOps is Software Development Strategy, which helps to promote the collaboration between the teams like Development Teams and Operations Teams in order to achieve Continuous Development, Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment and Continuous Monitoring in more automated fashion. 
		
	- How to Implement DevOps ???
	
		--> Identify the Teams involved in the overall SDLC process :::
		
			- DevOps Team ==> 
			
				- Infra-Structure Management Team
				- Application Development Team 
				- Testing Team 
				- Release Management Team 
				- Production Support Team 
				- Production Monitoring Team 
				- IT Security Team 			
				
			- ALM - Application LifeCycle Management Tool - Jira/AzBoard 
			
			-> Onboard Applications to DevOps :
			
				-> Detailed DevOps Assessment!
				
					- Recommendations --> 
					
			
		--> Identify the Enviroments :::
		
			Non-Prod Enviroment					Prod Enviroments
			
				- Dev 
				
				- Build 
				
				- Test 
				
					- QA 
					
					- UAT 		============>		Prod_Servers 
				
				
		--> DevOps Stages :::
			
			- Continuous Development 
				-> It is the capability of any development team to continuously develop the code.
				-> In DevOps this Continuous Development Stage is used to Improve the Developers' Productivity.
				
				Role of Developer : 

					- Understand the Design 
					- Create the Source Code 
					
				Developer :
				
					- Create Source Code 	--> java/python
					- Build Source Code 	--> Compile 
					- Create Application Artifacts - Binary(*.exec/*.dll/*.war)
					- Perform unit Testing 
					- Promote the Changes to Test Enviroments
					- Notify the Testing Team 
					
				Using DevOps :
				
					- Create Source Code 	--> java/python
					- Save the source Code in the Code Repository(github)
					
				Automate :
				
					- Application Build 
					- Create Artifacts 
					- Automated Unit Testing 
					- Code Promotion 
					- Automate Notification 
					
				
				Tools :
				
					- IDE - Integrated Development Enviroment - Eclipse based IDE - Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Pycharm, Anaconda IDEs 
					- Git/Github
					
					Visual Studio Code.
					GitHub Source Code Management
			
			- Continuous Integration :
			
				- It is the capability of any development team to continuously integrate the their changes to higher environment for further testing
				
				Automate :
				
					- Application Build 
					- Create Artifacts 
					- Automated Unit Testing 
					- Code Promotion 
					- Automate Notification 
						
				Tool: 
					- IDE - Integrated Development Enviroment - Eclipse based IDE - Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Pycharm, Anaconda IDEs 
					- Git/Github
					
					- Build Tools 
					
					- Docker / Kubernetes / Ansible 
					
					- Jenkins/Github-Action/Azure Pipelines
					
			
			- Continuous Testing ::

				- It is the capability of any testing team to continuously test the changes without waiting/impacting other changes.
				
				Tools :
				
					- Junit/TestNG/Selenium 
					- Jenkins/Github-Action/Azure Pipelines
				
				
			- Continuous Delivery/Deployment ::
										
				- Application Architecture ::: (DevOps Perspective)
				
					- Monolith Application Architecture
						- Tightly Coupled
						- All the dependencies are coded together  like the legacy application 
						- It is not that easy to split this to Micro-Services.
						- We can achieve Continuous Delivery. Not Continuous Deployment.
					
					- Micro-Service based Application Architecture 
					
						- Here the functions/Modules are loosely coupled. 
						- Each and every function are called as Micro-Service
						- Each Micro-Service can be independently developed, tested and Implemented to Prod.
						- To achieve Continuous Deployment, it should be Micro-Service based Architecture.						
						
				- Continuous Delivery 
					- It is a process to release to changes to Prod Enviroment, This process expects Manual approvals for Prod release.

				
						Eg,: 
						
							Online Banking Services : Monolith 
							
								-> Downtime ==> Production Release Window 
												-> 4Hrs - 6Hrs
												
								-> New_Version --> Fix the Issue / Revert the changes 
								
					
				- Continuous Deployment 
					- It is a process to release to changes to Prod Enviroment, This process Never expects any Manual intervension/approvals for Prod release.
					- Deploy the Changes to Production without any downtime using Deployment Strategies.				
									
				Tools :				
				
					- Docker/Kubernetes 
					- Jenkins/Github-Action/Azure_Pipelines
					- Ansible 
				
				
					Eg: facebook/Netflix/amazon : Micro-Service based Application Architecture

			- Continuous Monitoring ::
			
				- It is used to achieve Business Continuity
				- To ensure High Availability of Production Infra-Structure and Application Services. 
		
		
				- Infra-Structure 	--> Prod Servers and Resources 
				
				- Application Services 
			
		
				- Monitoring Tools :
				
					- Infra-Structure Monitoring Tools :
					
						- Prometheus, Grafana, Dynatrace, splunk, Mlflow 
						- AWS CloudWatch
						
					- Application Monitoring Tools :
					
						- DataDog, AppDynamics
						
						- Micro-Services --> Database
